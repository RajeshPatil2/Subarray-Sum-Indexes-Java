PROJECT NAME
Subarray Sum Indexes – Java (DSA Interview Problem)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project solves the classic "Indexes of Subarray
Sum" problem which is frequently asked in interviews
by companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Visa, etc.

Given an array of positive integers and a target sum,
the program finds the starting and ending indexes
of the first subarray whose sum equals the target.

Example:
Array  : [1, 2, 3, 7, 5]
Target : 12
Output : Indexes (2, 4) → [3, 7, 5]


TECH STACK

- Java
- Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- Sliding Window Technique

ALGORITHM USED

Sliding Window (Two Pointer Technique)

- Maintain a window with start and end pointers
- Add elements to current sum
- Shrink window if sum exceeds target
- Stop when target sum is found


TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY
Time Complexity  : O(n)
Space Complexity : O(1)
